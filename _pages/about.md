I am interested in biologic applications for deep generative modeling. As a computationalist my research has
been focused on understanding human disease through transcriptomics. I have developed multiple tools
using statistics and generative AI to uncover temporal gene regulatory networks important in the transition
of single-cell towards new states. My aim is to continue using machine learning on biologic data with
perturbation, temporal, or spatial information, specifically in single-cells and in transciptomic contexts.

When I'm not doing research I enjoy rock climbing, sailing, snowboarding, traveling, and playing guitar.
